Fork of [BaK GL](https://github.com/xavieran/BaKGL) where I experiment with typescript-C++ interop for my own pleasure.

[QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs) is used to make C++ able to call typescript functions.

[bun:ffi](https://bun.sh/docs/api/ffi) will probably be used to make typescript able to call C++ functions.
